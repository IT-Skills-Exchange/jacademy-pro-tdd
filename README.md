# Java Academy (Middle - Senior)

Version: **1.1**

Welcome to <i>JAcademy Pro</i>, an educational initiative designed to update software engineers' skills and knowledge
in order to enhance their ability to design and develop programs efficiently.
This program covers a wide range of programming topics, each featuring a brief explanation of a common challenge and
effective solutions to help you overcome it.

## Test-Driven Development

Welcome to the chapter on Test-Driven Development (TDD)! TDD is an approach that emphasizes writing tests before writing code.
In this chapter, we will explore the principles and practices of TDD, helping you build more reliable software.

TDD follows a cycle of writing tests, writing code to pass the tests, and refactoring. This iterative process ensures code
quality and adaptability.

Throughout this chapter, we will cover effective unit testing, testing frameworks, and integrating TDD into your workflow.
By the end, you will be equipped to apply TDD principles to your projects, improving code quality and efficiency.

Let's dive into the world of TDD and harness its power to enhance your software development process.
